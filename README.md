# Climbing Kings Bluff API: an API for the client side CKB

I created this API as practice for new skills learned. To gain a better understanding of mongoose and other new technologies.

**Planning Story**

I needed to build an API and a client that used it. I started with planning thinking about how I would need to access a data base of climbs and be able to display them to a user. A user would also need to be able to signin/out, edit a previous logged climb. The plan was to make sure the API could support these features using CRUD.

**Technologies Used**
JavaScript 
Mongoose 

**Unsolved Problems**
A route for just one users climbs
